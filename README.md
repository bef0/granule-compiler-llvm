# granule-compiler-llvm
LLVM compiler for Granule. This is a prototype which compiles on the functional core of Granule and does not yet support custom ADTs and GADTs.

# Installation

Installation requires the Granule front-end to be installed (see https://github.com/granule-project/granule).
Then you can build this project via:

      stack install :grc
   
For general instructions on `stack` and the Granule build process, see the core repo.
